# realme-ui-1-debloater
While debloating my realme device , i just made the debloater helper so that others won't need to dig and manually type each commands every time they wanna debloat their device.
A computer with adb installed is a requirement.

To reinstall an uninstalled package , use the command
"adb shell pm install-existing \<package name\>"
OR
"adb shell cmd package install-existing \<package name\>"

To enable a disabled package
"adb shell pm enable \<package name\>"
